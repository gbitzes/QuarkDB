# Getting started

After following the instructions in this chapter, by the end you will have
a fully-functional QuarkDB cluster. The steps are:

* [Installation](INSTALLATION.md): Install the QuarkDB binaries into your local system,
  along with the necessary dependencies.

* [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md): Decide which nodes will be part of the QuarkDB
  cluster, and configure them.

* [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md): A list of common errors encountered
  during setup, and how to solve them.
